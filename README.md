I have made an equity research report on Netflix,Inc.
This report includes company background, performance, financials and valuations
The valuation methods used in this are DCF and Relative valuations
Along with the valuations, it includes football field and technical analysis
The report's outcome is suggested as a 'Buy' considering the intrinsic values
